# 🚀 Cosen — Full Project Report
### Campus Marketplace | Status: Production Deployed | June 2026

---

## 💡 The Vision

**Cosen** is a **university-verified, peer-to-peer service marketplace** — think Fiverr, but exclusively for campus students.

> *"Every campus is full of hidden talent. A student who can code sits next to one who needs a website. Cosen connects them."*

### Core Idea
- Students **sell** their skills (coding, design, writing, tutoring, data, music…)
- Students **hire** verified campus peers with **escrow payment protection**
- Everyone is verified via **university email** (`.edu` / `.ac.in`) + ID card upload
- Real-time chat for every order + peer-to-peer DMs
- A reputation system (ratings + reviews) that stays on-platform

### Why It Matters
| Problem | Cosen's Solution |
|---|---|
| Skills go unused on campus | Marketplace to monetize them |
| Hiring freelancers is expensive | Peer pricing, campus rates |
| No trust between strangers | University email verification + ID card |
| Payment disputes | Razorpay escrow — paid only on delivery |
| No real-time coordination | Socket.io order chat + DM inbox |

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | React 19 + Vite, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, React Router v7 |
| **Backend** | Node.js + Express 4 |
| **Real-time** | Socket.io 4 (order chat + peer DMs) |
| **Database** | Supabase (PostgreSQL) — full schema with FTS, triggers, cascades |
| **Auth** | JWT + Google OAuth2 |
| **Payments** | Razorpay (Indian gateway) + escrow flow |
| **Storage** | Cloudinary (avatars, service images, student ID cards) |
| **Email** | Brevo HTTP API (works on Railway, any recipient) |
| **Deployment** | Railway (backend) + Railway (frontend) |

- **Incognito Aliases** — Dynamic fallback alias generation for "SendiYou" mode across all messaging routes to protect user identity.
- **Role Upgrade Flow** — An automated modal intercept that detects when basic "student" accounts attempt to post standard services, seamlessly prompting and upgrading them to "Student + Seller" roles via a new backend endpoint (bypassed for independent SendiYou connections).

### Phase 9 — Razorpay Compliance & Landing UI ✅ (June 5, 2026 Update)
- **Landing Page Redesign** — Transformed the "What Cosen is" section into a sleek, modern Vercel-style Bento Grid using high-quality integrated Hero Banner images.
- **Premium Typography** — Overhauled landing page typography to mimic high-end Figma designs, utilizing standard sans-serif (Plus Jakarta Sans/Inter), subtle badges, semantic line-wrapping, and professional punctuation (removing AI-generated em-dashes).
- **Razorpay Legal Compliance** — Created a comprehensive, structured Footer containing required links (Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions, Refund Policy, Contact Us), brand information, and responsive layout.
- **SVG Asset Replacement** — Exchanged faulty or missing Lucide-react export icons (e.g., Instagram) with robust inline SVG paths to guarantee successful production builds.

## ⏳ What's Pending (Not Yet Built)

### 🔴 High Priority — Core Gaps
- [ ] **Email notifications for orders** — notify buyer when seller delivers, notify seller when order is placed
- [ ] **Read receipts in DM** — mark messages as read when conversation is opened
- [ ] **Edit/Delete own service** — frontend UI for service management (API exists, no UI)
- [ ] **OTP email verification** — verify that OTP actually arrives reliably post-Brevo switch (test in production)

### 🟡 Medium Priority — UX Polish
- [ ] **In-app notification bell** — real-time feed for order updates, new messages, reviews
- [ ] **Service search improvements** — price range slider, min-rating filter, delivery-time filter
- [ ] **Typing indicators** in DM chat
- [ ] **File attachments** in order chat and DMs
- [ ] **Saved/bookmarked services** — wishlist for buyers
- [ ] **Seller analytics** — views, click-through rate, orders conversion per service
- [ ] **Service packages** — Basic / Standard / Premium tiers per service

### 🟠 Trust & Safety
- [ ] **Admin panel** — view users, services, orders; ban/suspend; dispute mediation
- [ ] **Dispute resolution flow** — buyer raises dispute → admin reviews → manual resolution
- [ ] **Seller levels** — Bronze / Silver / Gold based on completed orders & ratings
- [ ] **Portfolio section** — sellers attach past work samples to profile

### 🔵 Long-Term / Growth
- [ ] **Mobile app** — React Native with push notifications
- [ ] **University sub-marketplaces** — multi-tenant (one Cosen per university)
- [ ] **AI recommendations** — personalized service feed based on browsing
- [ ] **Campus leaderboard** — top earners per university per semester
- [ ] **International payments** — Stripe for non-India campuses

## 📱 SMS / Phone Verification — Migration Log (May 13–14, 2026)

This section documents the full journey of attempting to add phone number verification to the onboarding flow.

### Attempt 1 — Brevo SMS (Legacy, Removed)
The original codebase had a Brevo SMS integration (`server/utils/sendSms.js`) using the Brevo transactional SMS API.
- **Removed** because Brevo provides very few free SMS credits per month, making it unsustainable for user growth.

---

### Attempt 2 — Firebase Phone Authentication

**Goal:** Use Firebase Phone Auth (free tier: ~10,000 SMS/month) for OTP verification.

**Changes Made:**
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `client/src/lib/firebase.js` | [NEW] Created Firebase client SDK initialization file using `VITE_FIREBASE_*` env vars |
| `client/src/pages/Onboarding.jsx` | Integrated `RecaptchaVerifier` + `signInWithPhoneNumber` from `firebase/auth` |
| `client/src/store/authStore.js` | Added `linkFirebasePhone(idToken)` method to call the backend verify endpoint |
| `server/config/firebaseAdmin.js` | [NEW] Firebase Admin SDK initialization using service account credentials |
| `server/routes/auth.js` | Added `POST /api/auth/firebase-phone-verify` route to validate Firebase ID tokens |
| `server/utils/sendSms.js` | Deleted the legacy Brevo SMS utility |
| `server/.env` | Added `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`, `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` |
| `client/.env` | Added `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`, `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`, `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID` |

**Errors Encountered & Fixed:**
| Error | Root Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Cannot find module '../utils/sendSms'` | Old import still in `auth.js` after deleting the file | Removed the import |
| `⚠️ Firebase Admin configuration is missing` | `.env` was saved in UTF-16LE encoding, Dotenv couldn't read it | Converted `.env` to UTF-8 |
| `auth/operation-not-allowed` | Phone sign-in provider was not enabled in Firebase Console | Enabled Phone provider in Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method |
| `auth/billing-not-enabled` | Firebase requires a Blaze (Pay-as-you-go) plan to send real SMS | **Blocker** — could not resolve |
| `[OR_BACR2_44]` | Google Cloud billing rejected card (India debit card restrictions) | **Blocker** — could not resolve |

**Outcome: ❌ Abandoned.** Google Cloud Billing refused all payment methods (India debit card restriction). Firebase Phone Auth requires the Blaze plan regardless of free quota.

---

### Attempt 3 — Fast2SMS

**Goal:** Use Fast2SMS (India-specific SMS provider) — claimed to work without credit card.

**Changes Made:**
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `client/src/lib/firebase.js` | [DELETED] Removed Firebase client SDK |
| `server/config/firebaseAdmin.js` | [DELETED] Removed Firebase Admin SDK |
| `server/utils/sendSms.js` | [NEW] Created Fast2SMS OTP utility using `axios` POST to `https://www.fast2sms.com/dev/bulkV2` |
| `server/routes/auth.js` | Replaced `POST /firebase-phone-verify` with `POST /send-phone-otp` + `POST /verify-phone-otp` |
| `server/.env` | Removed Firebase keys, added `FAST2SMS_API_KEY` |
| `client/.env` | Removed all `VITE_FIREBASE_*` variables |
| `client/src/store/authStore.js` | Replaced `linkFirebasePhone` with `sendPhoneOtp(phone)` and `verifyPhoneOtp(otp)` |
| `client/src/pages/Onboarding.jsx` | Removed `RecaptchaVerifier`, Firebase imports; reconnected to `sendPhoneOtp` / `verifyPhoneOtp` store methods |

**Errors Encountered:**
| Error | Root Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `500` on `/send-phone-otp` (client `.env` blank page) | `.env` saved in wrong encoding, Vite couldn't read Firebase vars | Rewrote `client/.env` as clean UTF-8 |
| Build failed on Railway: `cannot resolve firebase/auth` | `package.json` not committed to GitHub — Railway didn't install Firebase | Committed `package.json` and `package-lock.json` for both client & server |
| `500` — `FAST2SMS_API_KEY is not configured` | API key not added to Railway Backend environment variables | Added to Railway Variables |
| `400` — number format rejected | Was sending `+919876543210` but Fast2SMS expects `9876543210` | Fixed `sendSms.js` to strip `+91` prefix |
| `status_code: 996` — website not verified | Fast2SMS OTP API requires DLT registration + website verification | **Blocker** — see below |

**Outcome: ❌ Abandoned.** Fast2SMS OTP API requires **DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) registration** — a mandatory TRAI (India telecom regulator) compliance process requiring a registered business entity, approved Sender ID, and approved message templates. This process takes weeks and is meant for established businesses.

---

### Current State — Phone Verification Suspended

**The `send-phone-otp` and `verify-phone-otp` backend routes remain in the codebase** but are non-functional without a DLT-registered SMS provider.

The `sendSms.js` utility is also kept for future use once DLT registration is completed.

**Recommended next steps for phone verification:**
1. **Short-term:** Make phone number collection **optional** in the onboarding wizard (skip OTP requirement). Email verification is the primary trust signal.
2. **Long-term:** Complete DLT registration as a business entity and re-enable Fast2SMS or MSG91 OTP routes.

## 📅 Daily Work Log

### May 17, 2026 — Negotiable Services & Bug Squashing
**Objective**: Build a dynamic price negotiation phase for services like "Study Helper" and resolve persisting UI bugs.

**Features Implemented:**
- **Service Sub-Categorization**: Added specialized fields (Assignment, Tutorial, Manual, Custom) and an `isNegotiable` toggle when posting a new service.
- **Dynamic Negotiation Workflow**: 
  - Orders for negotiable services now begin in a `pending_negotiation` state.
  - Built a dedicated negotiation UI in the order chat where sellers can enter an agreed-upon "Locked Price".
- **Pending Payment Flow**: Created robust Razorpay endpoints (`create-order-for-pending`, `verify-pending`) allowing buyers to smoothly pay the custom locked price without leaving the order screen.

**Bug Fixes & UX Polish:**
- **Mobile Navbar Fix**: Repaired the outside-click detector that was instantly collapsing the mobile notification sheet when tapped.
- **Mobile Notification Routing**: Fixed a race condition with React Router's `<Link>` that prevented mobile notifications from redirecting to their target URLs.
- **Accurate Online Indicators**: Rewrote the Order Chat header's green tick logic. It now leverages `Socket.io` user presence (`online_users_list`, `user_online`, `user_offline`) to accurately display whether the other party is actually online, instead of blindly trusting the local socket state.
- **Payment Success Payload**: Fixed a blank page crash after payment verification by ensuring the backend `select()` query returns nested buyer, seller, and service relations.
- **Inline Success Banners**: Replaced intrusive browser alerts with smooth, inline green banners during the price locking phase.

---

### May 18, 2026 — Art & Design Customization & Portfolio Uplift
**Objective**: Build a high-fidelity guided posting experience for the **Art & Design** service category, enabling specialized subtypes, automated templates, and work portfolio samples.

**Features Implemented:**
- **Guided Subtype Selector**: Selecting the *Art & Design* category now displays 7 modern tile cards:
  - 🎨 Poster & Banner Help
  - 📊 Presentation Help
  - 📄 Resume Help
  - 📸 Instagram Posts & Thumbnails
  - ▶️ YouTube Thumbnails
  - 🖥️ Website UI Design
  - ✨ Custom Service
- **Smart Description Templates**: Integrated context-aware description templates. When a subtype is clicked, it automatically pre-fills the description with high-quality copy to streamline the onboarding experience for service providers.
- **Past Work Samples (Portfolio)**: Built a multi-image upload component allowing designers to upload up to 5 portfolio images of past work with high-quality upload feedback and a dynamic preview grid.
- **Work Gallery UI**: Enhanced `ServiceDetail.jsx` with a dedicated **Past Work Samples** showcase grid featuring hover zoom transitions, backdrop filters, and click-to-view-full overlays.
- **Backend Services Extension**: Updated `server/routes/services.js` mapper (`mapService`), creator, and updater to fully support arrays under the `portfolio_images` column.

**Difficulties & Solutions:**
- **Supabase RPC/SQL Limits**: We tried running SQL migrations dynamically using client rpc (`exec_sql`) and direct REST headers, but the hosted REST schema cache was not exposed or preconfigured for administrative functions.
- **DNS Resolution Blocker**: Browser subagent was unable to resolve `supabase.com` due to container environment restrictions.
- **Resolution**: Created a local check utility `add_portfolio_column.js` and printed a copy-pasteable SQL block so the user can easily execute the migration directly inside their Supabase dashboard editor.

---

### May 18, 2026 — Food Friendship Category Launch & Dynamic Form Customization
**Objective**: Successfully launch the **Food Friendship** marketplace category to replace the legacy *Writing & CV* category, customize the posting wizard with category-specific options (Veg/Non-Veg/Both), implement dynamic label/placeholder guide systems for Title and Description, and optimize backend validation.

**Features Implemented:**
- **"Food Friendship" Transition**: Fully retired the "Writing & CV" category and deployed "Food Friendship" (using `UtensilsCrossed` icon) across all components (Navbar, Landing page, Browse marketplace, Signup onboarding, and backend service whitelist).
- **Specialized Food Flow**: Selecting *Food Friendship* displays a visual dietary selection card where users choose between Veg 🟢, Non-Veg 🔴, and Both 🟡 options.
- **Dynamic Field Customizer**: Re-engineered Title and Description fields inside the posting wizard:
  - Both fields now change their label (e.g. *Food Item Name*, *Food Description*) and their helper placeholders dynamically depending on which category is chosen, making the seller signup experience intuitive and contextual.
- **Low-Price Threshold**: Allowed peers to share cheap meals on campus by adjusting the frontend/backend minimum price threshold to **₹10** exclusively for the *Food Friendship* category, down from the standard ₹50 minimum.
- **SQL Migration Utilities**: Created a clean PostgreSQL migration script [migrate_food_friendship.sql](file:///c:/Users/HP/OneDrive/Desktop/copy_try/server/supabase/migrate_food_friendship.sql) to add the `'Food Friendship'` enum value to `service_category` and drop/re-add the table's price constraint `CHECK (price >= 10)`.

---

### May 19, 2026 — Photography Category Integration & Rich Media Portfolios
**Objective**: Retire the legacy *Research & Data* category and successfully deploy **Photography**, featuring interactive camera type cards, a custom Camera Model field with smart DB description packing/unpacking, and multi-file image/video past work uploads with looping micro-previews.

**Features Implemented:**
- **"Photography" Category Transition**: Replaced the "Research & Data" category system-wide (Navbar, Browse, Landing page featured portrait photography service, Interest wizard inside Signup, and backend whitelists).
- **Guided Camera Type Selector**: Selecting *Photography* displays 5 camera type selector tiles:
  - 📸 DSLR Cameras
  - 📷 Mirrorless Cameras
  - 🎦 Action Cameras
  - 📸 Point & Shoot
  - 🎞️ Instant Cameras
- **Camera Model Custom Field**: Added a dedicated `Camera Model` input field for Photography. The model is saved by appending it to the `description` text payload using bold emoji markup, and dynamically parsed back on edit state load. This allows custom inputs without database schema column additions.
- **Rich Past Work Gallery (Images & Videos)**: Re-engineered the design portfolio uploader into a generic past work gallery for both Art and Photography. Photography accepts videos as well as images up to **15MB** (`accept="image/*,video/*"`).
- **Micro-preview Loop Player**: Configured both `PostService.jsx` previews and `ServiceDetail.jsx` past work gallery cards to automatically detect video extensions (`.mp4`, `.mov`, etc.) and render a premium, looping, muted `<video>` player element.
- **Supabase Enum Migration**: Created [migrate_photography.sql](file:///c:/Users/HP/OneDrive/Desktop/copy_try/server/supabase/migrate_photography.sql) containing the DDL command to alter the `service_category` type with `'Photography'`.

---

### May 19, 2026 — Playground Category Launch & Double-Escrow Verdict Match System
**Objective**: Build a premium **Playground** category where campus students can post matches, challenge other teams, and win prizes using a secure Double-Escrow platform vault.

**Features Implemented:**
- **"Playground" Category Integration**: Deployed a fully-integrated `Playground` category with a customized Trophy 🏆 / Amber theme across Navbar, Landing page, Browse search list, Signup onboarding wizard, and backend routes.
- **Visual Marketplace Indicators**: Enhanced browse cards and details page to dynamically parse custom metadata (e.g. `🏟️ Campus Ground Booked` status) and display high-fidelity Trust Pills in matching color palettes.
- **Posting Wizard Parameter Extraction**: Integrated specialized custom inputs for playground match posts (Game Name, Playground Location, Campus Ground Booking Status [Yes/No], and Team Size). Parameters are packed using custom emojis (`🎮`, `🏟️`, `📍`, `👥`) inside the main `description` field for maximum compatibility, and flawlessly unpacked during service editing.
- **Double-Escrow Razorpay Checkout**: 
  - Once the challenger (buyer) purchases the service, their entry fee is locked in the platform escrow vault.
  - The match host (seller) is then prompted to match the entry fee. A dedicated `Pay Entry Fee` action triggers Razorpay payment which sets `seller_paid: true` in the orders database, shifting the match status to `inProgress`.
- **In-App Challenge Notifications**: Integrated automatic, real-time in-app notification triggers:
  - When a buyer pays, the seller instantly receives an in-app notification to match the entry fee (*"🏆 Match Entry Fee Challenge! [Buyer] paid their entry fee... Match the fee now to activate the game!"*).
  - When the host pays, the buyer instantly receives a notification confirming the match is active (*"🎮 Match Challenge Accepted! The host matched the entry fee. Your challenge is active!"*).
- **Outcome Visibility Guard**: Enforced double-payment checking. The outcome verdict voting dashboard is completely hidden from both players until both have successfully completed their entry fee payments.
- **Dynamic Revision Filtering**: Restricted the delivery "3 revisions" pill and description tags to display ONLY for the **Study Helper** category. The revisions section has been completely removed across all other categories (Tech, Art, Food, Photography, and Playground) for cleaner UX.
- **Match Verdict Outcome Voting**: 
  - Once active, both users see a high-fidelity Outcome Voting Dashboard inside the order screen asking "What is the match result?" with `🏆 I Won` and `💀 I Lost` options.
  - **Verdict Clash Resolution**: If both users claim the same result (e.g. both claim they won), the app displays the warning: *"please select the right option, do not select the same option"* and automatically resets both votes to allow corrected input.
  - **Prize Payout**: Upon a valid outcome agreement, the system deducts a 10% platform commission on the total pool and credits the net winnings (`1.8 * entry_fee`) directly to the winner's account (`winner_id`, `winner_earnings`), completing the match.
- **Dashboard Winnings Aggregation**: Fully updated `Dashboard.jsx` stats to aggregate Playground pool winnings as earnings and list entry fees under expenses.
- **Supabase Enum Migration**: Created [migrate_playground.sql](file:///c:/Users/HP/OneDrive/Desktop/copy_try/server/supabase/migrate_playground.sql) containing the DDL command to alter the `service_category` type with `'Playground'` and added the required escrow Columns to the `orders` database schema.

---

### May 22, 2026 — SendiYou Category Launch (Anonymous Campus Connections)
**Objective**: Introduce a new networking/dating category called **SendiYou** where users can post anonymous or public connection requests targeted at specific genders, with secure, mutually revealed chat mechanics.

**Features Implemented:**
- **"SendiYou" Category Integration**: Deployed the SendiYou category across the platform with a dedicated UI theme, removing standard delivery/revision concepts.
- **Specialized Posting Wizard**:
  - Added custom fields for SendiYou posts: **Display Name** (pseudonym), **Preferred Gender** (Male, Female, Any), and an **Identity Hidden** toggle.
  - Posts with hidden identity show the poster's profile as 🔒 Secret until mutual reveal.
- **Gender-Gated Acceptance**: 
  - Validates the acceptor's profile gender against the poster's `preferred_gender`.
  - Blocks users who haven't set their gender or don't match the required preference.
- **Match Lifecycle & Expiration**: 
  - Once accepted, a free order is generated, linking the users. The post is instantly deactivated.
  - Matches feature a strict **7-day expiration** timer (`expires_at`), after which the chat becomes read-only.
- **Mutual Reveal System**: 
  - Built a dual-opt-in reveal mechanic. Both users start anonymous (seeing "Secret" avatars and names).
  - Users can click "Reveal Identity" in the chat. Only when **both** parties have clicked reveal (`buyer_revealed=true` & `seller_revealed=true`) do the actual profiles, avatars, and phone numbers unmask.
- **Supabase Enum Migration**: Created [migrate_sendiyou.sql](file:///c:/Users/HP/OneDrive/Desktop/copy_try/server/supabase/migrate_sendiyou.sql) containing the DDL command to alter the `service_category` type with `'SendiYou'` and added the required columns for mutual reveal to the database.

---

### May 23, 2026 — Real-time Hybrid Chat Architecture & SendiYou Group Connections
**Objective**: Overhaul the chat delivery system to ensure absolute reliability across all deployment environments (bypassing CORS/Cookie limits) and expand the **SendiYou** category to support multi-user group chats for campus activities.

**Features Implemented:**
- **Hybrid Real-time Chat Architecture**: 
  - Restructured the messaging engine to use a **Hybrid REST + Socket.io** model.
  - Replaced purely socket-based `.emit()` message delivery with robust REST endpoints (`POST /api/conversations/:id/messages` and `POST /api/sendiyou/order/:orderId/messages`).
  - Added secure JWT-based handshake configuration (`auth: { token }`) for Socket.io connections, ensuring real-time presence and instant delivery broadcasting to active clients.
  - Implemented **Optimistic UI Updates** on the frontend, rendering sent messages instantly while the server processes the database commit.
- **SendiYou Group Connections (Multi-User Matching)**:
  - Added a `group_size` capacity parameter to the `services` table and a `buyer_ids` array to the `orders` table.
  - Updated the frontend `PostService.jsx` wizard with a dedicated, stylish **Group Size** counter UI (from 1 to 50 members) for the SendiYou category.
  - Rewrote backend matching logic (`sendiyou.js/accept`): Multiple users can now join a single SendiYou connection until the `group_size` limit is reached, gracefully pooling all participants into a shared order.
  - Added dynamic indicators to `ServiceDetail.jsx` highlighting the group capacity.
- **Group Members HUD & Chat Scrollability**:
  - Restructured the DOM flexbox layout in `OrderDetail.jsx` to enforce a strictly bounded, scrollable chat window height (`520px` via `minHeight`/`h-max`), preventing infinite stretching.
  - Injected a dynamic **👥 Group Members** badge in the chat header, visually mapping the participant count (e.g., `1/10 joined`) alongside stacked avatar pills for each joined member.
- **Supabase Multi-user Migration**: Authored and deployed [migrate_sendiyou_group.sql](file:///c:/Users/HP/OneDrive/Desktop/copy_try/server/supabase/migrate_sendiyou_group.sql) to execute the DDL schema additions for group scale.

### May 23, 2026 (Session 2) — Landing Page Vision Overhaul, Critical Group Chat Bug Fixes & SendiYou Reveal System Redesign

**Objective**: Realign the landing page with Cosen's evolved identity as a peer-connection platform (not just a marketplace), fix critical bugs preventing group members from accessing their chats, and redesign the SendiYou reveal system to support independent, per-user identity disclosure.

---

#### 🌐 Landing Page — New Vision & Identity

**Problem**: The landing page still communicated Cosen as a traditional "campus marketplace" (hire/sell framing), which no longer matched the platform's actual direction — connecting students to students based on need, not just selling services.

**Changes Made:**
- **Hero Headline** rewritten from *"The campus marketplace built for students"* → **"Every student has a need. We find the match."**
- **Hero subtext** updated from *"Hire verified campus peers..."* → *"Cosen connects you to the right student — not just a service."*
- **CTA buttons** updated: "Start for free" → **"Find your match"**, "Browse services" → **"Explore campus"**
- **New Vision Section** added (between hero and how-it-works) with three premium pillar cards:
  - 🎓 *Skills meet needs* — real value exchange, no middlemen
  - 💌 *Anonymous connections* — SendiYou explained clearly with consent mechanics
  - 👥 *Group connections* — cricket tournaments, study groups, clubs
  - A full-width dark quote banner: *"Not just a marketplace — a campus operating system where every student is both a provider and a seeker."* (set in **Merriweather** serif font for editorial emphasis)
- **New "Connections Beyond Transactions" Dark Section** added showcasing the 3 core connection types (Skill Connections, SendiYou, Group Connections) with card-based UI featuring tag pills and descriptions
- **Categories section** header updated: *"Find your kind of student"* with new sub-description
- **Marquee Slider** updated to include *"Anonymous Match 💌"*, *"Cricket Group 🏏"*, *"Study Partner 📚"*
- **CTA Banner** rewritten: *"Your next connection is already on campus."* with trust strip (100% student-verified, anonymous connections, group & 1-on-1 chats, escrow-protected)
- **Typography**: Applied **Playwrite México Guides** (cursive script) to the SendiYou spotlight heading for a distinctive, expressive feel
- **Build fix**: Escaped unescaped apostrophe in JS string that broke Vite production build (`you're` inside single-quoted string)

#### 🐛 Critical Bug — Group Members Could Not Access Order/Chat

**Problem**: When the 2nd (or any subsequent) person joined a SendiYou group and tried to enter the group chat, they received: **"Failed to load order details."**

**Root Cause Analysis (3 bugs):**

| # | File | Bug | Impact |
|---|------|-----|--------|
| 1 | `server/routes/messages.js` | `verifyOrderAccess()` only checked `buyer_id` + `seller_id` — not `buyer_ids[]` | Group members got **HTTP 403** on both GET messages and POST message |
| 2 | `server/routes/orders.js` | `.or()` with `buyer_ids.cs.{uuid}` — invalid PostgREST syntax for UUID arrays with hyphens | Group members' orders **never appeared** in the dashboard order list |
| 3 | `client/src/pages/OrderDetail.jsx` | `order.buyer._id === user._id` — hard crash for group members not equal to `buyer_id`; `isBuyer`/`otherParty` became undefined | **Client-side crash** on page load for any group member except the first joiner |

**Fixes Applied:**
- **`messages.js`**: Updated `verifyOrderAccess()` to fetch `buyer_ids` column and check `(order.buyer_ids || []).includes(userId)` as a third access condition
- **`orders.js` GET `/`**: Replaced broken `.or()` filter with **two separate Supabase queries** (one for `buyer_id`/`seller_id`, one using `.contains('buyer_ids', [userId])`) then merged + deduplicated results by ID in memory
- **`OrderDetail.jsx`**: Added `isGroupMember = (order.buyerIds || []).includes(user._id)` fallback so all group joiners are treated as buyer-side; used optional chaining (`order.buyer?._id`) throughout to prevent null crashes

---

#### 💌 SendiYou Reveal System — Architecture Overhaul

**Problem (Old Logic):** Both parties had to click "Show my profile" before either could see the other — a strict mutual consent gate. This didn't work well for groups (multiple buyers, but only one `buyer_revealed` boolean) and felt restrictive even for 1-on-1.

**New Logic (Independent Reveal):**
- Any participant — buyer, seller, or any group member — clicking "Show my profile" **immediately makes their profile visible to everyone else** in that chat
- No mutual consent required. If Person A reveals → everyone sees Person A. If Person B hasn't revealed → Person B stays hidden
- Fully works for groups of any size

**Technical Changes:**

| Layer | Change |
|-------|--------|
| **Database** | Added `revealed_ids uuid[] DEFAULT '{}'` column to `orders` table (migration SQL: `ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS revealed_ids uuid[] DEFAULT '{}'::uuid[];`) |
| **`server/routes/sendiyou.js`** | Reveal route now toggles user's own ID in/out of `revealed_ids[]` array instead of flipping `buyer_revealed`/`seller_revealed` booleans; access check expanded to include all `buyer_ids` group members |
| **`server/routes/orders.js`** | Added `revealedIds: order.revealed_ids \|\| []` to `mapOrder()` output |
| **`client/src/pages/OrderDetail.jsx`** | Replaced `isMutualReveal` logic with `revealedOthers = revealedIds.filter(id => id !== user._id)`; profile cards render for **each revealed person** independently; hint text dynamically shows count of revealed members |

---

#### 🔤 Typography Additions
- **Merriweather** (serif, editorial) — added to Google Fonts import; applied to the vision quote banner
- **Playwrite México Guides** (cursive script) — added to Google Fonts import; applied to the SendiYou spotlight section heading

---

---

### May 29, 2026
#### 1. Landing Page Redesign
- Redesigned the Landing page (`client/src/pages/Landing.jsx`) to a high-contrast, editorial, asymmetric layout.
- Removed "AI-generated" aesthetics (blobs, generic gradients) and applied modern typography, rich colors, and intentional whitespace.

#### 2. Authentication Pages Overhaul
- Completely redesigned `Login.jsx` and `Signup.jsx` into a premium, clean, light-mode interface (slate-50 background).
- Refined typography and structural layout to feel high-end and editorial.
- Polished the `Profile` (Step 2) and `Interests` (Step 3) stages of the Signup flow with custom radio cards, crisp border hover effects, and modern select inputs.

#### 3. Navbar Visibility & Integration
- Modified `Navbar.jsx` to conditionally hide the global navigation bar on all auth pages (`/login`, `/signup`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`).
- Resolved visual overlap between the global navbar and the auth-specific brand logo headers.

#### 4. Mandatory Phone Number in Signup
- Added a mandatory `Phone Number` field to the first step of the signup flow.
- Configured frontend validation to require a 10-digit phone number and added an explanatory placeholder note indicating verification will occur later.
- Updated `server/routes/auth.js` register endpoint to parse, save, and persist `phone` and `isPhoneVerified` into the Supabase database.
- Ensured phone number passes cleanly through the frontend `authStore`.

#### 5. Browse Page Category Pills
- Restyled the category selection pills in `Browse.jsx` to resemble premium tags rather than basic buttons.
- Applied `rounded-xl`, subtle shadow states, hover micro-animations (`-translate-y-0.5`), and an editorial dark slate gradient for the active state (`linear-gradient(135deg, #0F172A, #334155)`).

#### 6. ServiceDetail & PostService Minor UI Adjustments
- **ServiceDetail.jsx:** Conditionally hidden the "Delivery Time" and "Escrow Protected" pills at the bottom of the page when the `SendiYou` category is selected. 
- **ServiceDetail.jsx:** Conditionally hidden the "Delivery Time" pill when the `Playground` category is selected.
- **PostService.jsx:** Hidden the "Delivery Time" dropdown selection UI and bypassed its validation requirement when a user is posting a `Playground` category service, automatically defaulting it to 7 days in the background (similar to SendiYou).

---

### June 1-2, 2026 — Ranking System & SendiYou UI Hardening
**Objective**: Introduce a gamified ranking system with dynamic platform fee discounts, fix multiple edge-cases in SendiYou profile editing, and improve UI responsiveness.

#### 1. Dynamic Ranking System Implementation
- Built a gamified progression system for sellers based on completed valid orders.
- **Ranks & Perks**:
  - **Bronze**: Default rank (10% platform fee).
  - **Silver**: Unlocked at 100 valid orders (6% platform fee).
  - **Gold**: Unlocked at 200 valid orders (3% platform fee).
- Implemented backend verification logic in `orders.js` to automatically calculate fees on checkout based on the seller's rank.
- Integrated fully automated **email and in-app notifications** for rank upgrades, triggering celebratory messages when a seller levels up.
- *Note:* The `SendiYou` category is explicitly excluded from counting towards rank progression.

#### 2. Dashboard Time Filtering
- Upgraded the Dashboard (`Dashboard.jsx`) by wiring up functional time-based data filters.
- Sellers and buyers can now filter their earnings, expenses, and order statistics by **Last 7 Days**, **Weeks**, and **Months**.

#### 3. SendiYou Edit Form Lockdown
- **Problem**: Users could change their gender preference, group size, or anonymous status *after* posting a SendiYou request, causing mismatches and privacy logic conflicts.
- **Solution**: Locked down all core mechanics on `PostService.jsx` during edit mode. 
- Fields like `Category`, `Preferred Gender`, `Connection Type`, `Group Size`, and `Identity Hidden` are now disabled, visually faded out, and marked with a "Locked" badge during edits. Users can only edit safe fields (Title, Description, Display Name, Tags, Cover Image).

#### 4. Backend Display Name Persistence
- Fixed a bug where editing a SendiYou post's `Display Name` wasn't saving.
- Added `displayName: 'display_name'` to the `fieldMap` whitelist in `server/routes/services.js` (`PUT /services/:id`), enabling the backend to accept and commit the new display name to Supabase.

#### 5. Responsive Order Chat UI
- Fixed a rigid layout issue on the `OrderDetail.jsx` screen where the chat window was hardcoded to `520px` height.
- Re-engineered the chat container to use fluid, responsive CSS (`calc(100vh - 220px)` with `min-height: 500px`), making it feel significantly more native and comfortable on taller screens and mobile devices.

#### 6. Database Schema Hardening (Rank Column)
- Diagnosed a critical `404 Service not found` error caused by missing SQL schema updates for the new Ranking System. 
- The backend `orders.js` was querying `seller:users!seller_id(rank)` but the `rank` column did not exist.
- Resolved by adding the `rank` column (`ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN rank text DEFAULT 'bronze'`) and added explicit error logging `console.error(svcErr)` across `orders.js` to prevent Supabase errors from being silently swallowed in the future.

### June 21-22, 2026 — Timetable Detector, Razorpay Compliance & UI Polish
**Objective**: Introduce a new "Free Room Finder" utility for students, realign the landing page for payment gateway compliance, and smooth out the onboarding and dashboard experience.

#### 1. Landing Page Compliance (Razorpay)
- **Problem**: The landing page messaging felt too much like a dating or social network ("We find the match", "campus friend"), which violated Razorpay's compliance policies for a service marketplace.
- **Solution**: Rewrote the entire `Landing.jsx` copy to clearly position Cosen as a peer-to-peer service marketplace. Emphasized "Hire peers", "Freelance services", and "Secure escrow payments".
- **Category Reordering**: De-emphasized the `SendiYou` (anonymous connections) feature by moving it to the last position in the category grid and stripping out the prominent "215+" user count to keep the focus on professional/academic services.

#### 2. Timetable Detector (Free Room Finder)
- **Concept**: A brand new utility allowing students to select a campus building and instantly see which classrooms are free, occupied, or about to be busy.
- **Backend Architecture**:
  - Created new Supabase tables `timetable_slots` and `timetable_meta` via SQL migration.
  - Built an Admin Panel UI (`AdminTimetable.jsx`) to securely upload the master `PPSU_SOE_Master_Timetable.xlsx`.
  - Implemented an Express backend route utilizing `multer` and `xlsx` to parse the Excel file, extract core fields (Program, Class Code, Subject, Room, Building, Time), and bulk-insert them into Supabase.
- **Frontend UI (`Timetable.jsx`)**:
  - Built a dynamic UI showing real-time classroom statuses with visual indicators (Free Now, Busy Soon, In Use).
  - Designed an empty-state warning guide for when the database has no timetable uploaded yet.
  - Handled a UI bug where the global Navbar overlapped and hid the Timetable page header by applying correct padding offsets.
- **Bypassing API Limits (Critical Fix)**: 
  - Diagnosed a bug where Supabase's PostgREST default hard limit truncated the building list at 1,000 rows (omitting Block G, H, I, and Music Room).
  - Engineered a `.range()` pagination `while` loop on the backend to dynamically fetch all timetable rows in 1000-row chunks, ensuring 100% data retrieval.

#### 3. Onboarding Friction Removed
- **Problem**: New users were getting permanently stuck in the onboarding flow because Step 2 enforced mandatory Phone Number / WhatsApp OTP verification.
- **Solution**: Refactored `Onboarding.jsx` to make phone verification explicitly **Optional**. Users can now seamlessly click "Complete Profile" and reach the Dashboard without verifying a phone number.

#### 4. Dashboard "Dummy Data" Cleanup
- **Problem**: The `Dashboard.jsx` displayed hardcoded visual placeholders (e.g., ₹5,476 for Weekly Expenses, ₹9,800 for Earnings, 1,009 Total Orders) when real data was 0, confusing new users.
- **Solution**: Scrapped all fallback placeholder strings and hardcoded graph values. The dashboard now properly defaults to ₹0 and flat charts for brand-new users, accurately reflecting their real platform activity.

### July 14-15, 2026 — Manual UPI Payments, Timetable Decoupling & UI Enhancements
**Objective**: Introduce a robust manual payment system to bypass Razorpay requirements, clean up the codebase by removing the timetable utility to a standalone project, and improve the loading UX on the dashboard.

#### 1. Manual UPI Payment System (New Feature)
- **Concept**: A complete alternative to Razorpay, allowing buyers and sellers to transact directly via UPI. Razorpay is now marked as "Coming Soon".
- **Database Migration**: Added `payment_method` (default `'razorpay'`) and `manual_payment_status` to the `orders` table.
- **Backend Handshake API (`orders.js`)**:
  - `PUT /orders/:id/choose-manual-payment` — Buyer selects manual UPI payment.
  - `PUT /orders/:id/buyer-claimed-paid` — Buyer claims they have paid.
  - `PUT /orders/:id/seller-confirm-payment` — Seller confirms receipt → moves to `inProgress`.
  - `PUT /orders/:id/seller-reject-payment` — Seller rejects → resets to `awaiting_payment`.
- **Frontend UI Integration (`ServiceDetail.jsx`, `OrderDetail.jsx`)**: Built a full state-based handshake UI for both buyer and seller views.
- **No Commission Rule**: Removed platform fee deductions and escrow warning notices for manual payments, showing exact net earnings for the seller.

#### 2. UPI Deep Link Integration
- **Implementation**: Added a **UPI deep link button** (`upi://pay?pa=...`) that automatically opens preferred UPI apps (GPay, PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM) on mobile devices with pre-filled details (Seller UPI, Name, Amount, Order Note).
- **Responsive Fallback**: On desktop/laptop, the button shows an alert instructing users to switch to their mobile phone or use the displayed UPI ID manually.

#### 3. Timetable Feature Decoupled & Removed
- **Concept**: The "Free Room Finder" / Timetable feature was completely removed from the Cosen codebase and moved to a separate standalone project at `timbel.cosen.online`.
- **Cleanup execution**:
  - Deleted `Timetable.jsx`, `AdminTimetable.jsx`, `routes/timetable.js`, and `timetable_migration.sql`.
  - Removed API registration from `server.js` and React Router routes from `App.jsx`.
  - **Result**: Removed 1,229 lines of code, streamlining the marketplace architecture.
- **Navigation Update**: Replaced internal router links in `Navbar.jsx` with external `<a>` tags pointing directly to the new Timbel domain.

#### 4. Dashboard Skeleton Loader (UI Polish)
- **Problem**: The dashboard displayed a basic `LottieLoader` spinner during data fetches.
- **Solution**: Replaced the spinner with a **premium skeleton shimmer loader** mimicking the exact layout of the Dashboard content (Stat Cards, Gauge Chart, Line Chart, Transactions Table, and Calendar).
- **Animation**: Implemented `@keyframes skeletonShimmer` with a smooth sliding `linear-gradient` to match top-tier enterprise UI standards (e.g., Stripe).

#### 5. Bug Fixes
- **ServiceDetail.jsx Blank Screen**: Fixed a crash occurring when a user clicked the "Request Service & Negotiate" button by correctly importing the missing `ChevronRight` lucide icon.

### July 2026 � Admin Panel Manual Payments Updates
- **Separated Razorpay and Manual Metrics**: Updated the admin dashboard to correctly distinguish between Escrow Volume via Razorpay and Manual UPI Volume.
- **Payout Section Tabs**: Added tabs in the Admin Payouts section to filter completed payouts by Payment by Cosen and Manual User UPI Payment.
- **Prevent False Pending Payouts**: Ensured that manual orders do not generate pending payout records in the backend.
